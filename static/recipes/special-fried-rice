<h1>Special Fried Rice</h1>

2 3/4 cups water<br/>
1 1/2 cups white rice<br/>
3 tablespoons vegetable oil<br/>
2 eggs, beaten<br/>
2 cloves garlic, chopped<br/>
2 inches fresh ginger, minced or grated<br/>
1/2 cup shredded carrots<br/>
1 small red bell pepper, diced<br/>
4 scallions, thinly sliced on an angle<br/>
1/2 cup frozen peas<br/>
1/3 cup Tamari, dark aged soy sauce<br/>

1. Bring water to a boil. Add rice, reduce heat, cover and cook over
medium low heat until tender, 15 to 18 minutes. Spread rice out on a
cookie sheet to quick cool it.

2. Heat a wok, wok shaped skillet or large nonstick skillet over high
heat. Add oil to the pan. Add egg to hot oil and break into small bits
as it scrambles. When eggs are scrambled, add garlic and ginger to the
pan. Add carrots, pepper, scallions to the pan and quick stir-fry
veggies 2 minutes. Add rice to the pan and combine with veggies. Fry
rice with veggies 2 or 3 minutes. Add peas and soy sauce to the rice
and stir fry 1 minute more, then serve.

Notes (Mom): I use ground ginger instead of fresh. You can add cooked pork or chicken to it if you want, or other veggies.
