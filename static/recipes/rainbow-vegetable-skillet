<h1>Rainbow Vegetable Skillet</h1>

Yield: 9 servings

1 medium butternut squash (about 2 pounds)<br/>
1/4 cup reduced-fat butter, melted<br/>
2 tablespoons brown sugar<br/>
1 tablespoon chili powder<br/>
1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro<br/>
1 teaspoon salt<br/>
1/2 teaspoon pepper<br/>
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br/>
1 medium green pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces<br/>
1 medium sweet yellow pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces<br/>
1 medium red onion, cut into wedges<br/>
1 tablespoon olive oil<br/>
2 cups grape tomatoes<br/>

1. Cut squash in half; discard seeds. Place cut side down in a microwave-safe dish; add 1/2 in. of water. Microwave, uncovered, on high for 10-12 minutes or until almost tender.

2. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the butter, brown sugar, chili powder, cilantro, salt, pepper and cinnamon; set aside. When squash is cool enough to handle, peel and discard rind. Cut pulp into 1/2-in. pieces.

3. In a large skillet, saute peppers and onion in oil until tender. Add tomatoes and squash; heat through. Transfer to a large bowl; add butter mixture and toss to coat.
