<h1>Who are ya?</h1>
<p>
My <i>name</i> is Tim Horton (of no relation to 
the <a href="http://www.timhortons.com">fast-food chain</a>). I'm a junior in <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/">computer science</a> 
at <a href="http://www.rpi.edu">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>, in 
Troy, NY. I'm primarily a Mac user, though my main machine dual-boots <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> and <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a> for various <a href="http://valgrind.org/">r</a><a href="http://www.enlightenment.org/">e</a><a href="http://www.hydrogen-music.org/">a</a><a href="http://compiz.org/">s</a><a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">o</a><a href="http://gnome.org">n</a><a href="http://live.gnome.org/Seed">s</a>. I spend most of my free time either with a <a href="/computers.html">computer</a> or a camera, programming, or taking pictures &mdash; <a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/">Cocoa</a> and <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/ProductDetail.page?pid=25412">Nikon</a> being my preferences in those areas. I was a participant in <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">Google Summer of Code '08</a>; I spent my summer writing an engine allowing <a href="http://docs.enlightenment.org/api/evas/html/">Evas</a> to run natively under Mac OS X's rendering engine, Quartz. I returned again in 2009, this time working on 2.5D games for the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnome-games/">Gnome Games</a> collection. I'm also a proponent of <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">free</a> and <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open</a> licenses, placing most of my code under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a> and many photographs under various <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses.

<h1>What's this thing?</h1>
<p>
For a long while, I've been writing code, taking pictures, and thinking about things &mdash; creating lots of things that I really feel should be shared. I created this site as a means to that end, and, even if no one ever pays any attention, I've at least created an organized home for my ideas for <i>myself!</i> Everything here is here in a format that <i>I</i> understand, and you're all welcome to it. I'm willing to field questions, requests, hate mail, whatever, about anything on this site (or elsewhere!) through <a href="mailto:hortont424@gmail.com">email</a>, though I'll certainly not reply to everything!
