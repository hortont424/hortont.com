<h1>Who are you?</h1>
<p>
My <i>name</i> is Tim Horton (of no relation to
the <a href="http://www.timhortons.com">fast-food chain</a>). I'm a graduate of <a href="http://www.rpi.edu">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>, in
Troy, NY. I'm primarily a Mac user, but I dabble in whatever's necessary to do the job. I spend most of my free time either with a computer or a camera, programming, or taking pictures. I work on WebKit most of the time now; in the past, I did lots of other <a href="http://github.com/hortont424/">random</a> <a href="/projects">things</a>.</p>
<h1>What's this thing?</h1>
<p>
For a long while, I've been writing code, taking pictures, and thinking about things &mdash; creating lots of things that I really feel should be shared. I created this site as a means to that end, and, even if no one ever pays any attention, I've at least created an organized home for my ideas for <i>myself!</i> Everything here is here in a format that <i>I</i> understand, and you're all welcome to it. I'm willing to field questions, requests, hate mail, whatever, about anything on this site (or elsewhere!) through <a href="mailto:tim@hortont.com">email</a>, though I'll certainly not reply to everything!
