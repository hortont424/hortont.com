For RCOS during the 2009-10 school year, I'm working on an evolution-data-server-backed Gnome contact management program primarily written in Vala.

During the first semester, I presented an <a href="http://files.hortont.com/projects/sheeple-09-01.pdf">introduction</a> of the project, a <a href="http://files.hortont.com/projects/sheeple-09-02.pdf">recap</a> during the middle of the semester, and a <a href="http://files.hortont.com/projects/sheeple-09-03.pdf">final</a> progress report during the last week.

During the second semester, I presented a <a href="http://files.hortont.com/projects/sheeple-10-01.pdf">reintroduction</a> of the project.
