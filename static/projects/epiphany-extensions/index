<h1>Epiphany Extensions</h1>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://hortont.com/epiphany/">Repository</a></strong>

Robb replaced Epiphany's Python extension system with a JavaScript one, based on Seed. In order to acquaint people with the new way of doing things, we wrote some example extensions and placed them in the repository above.

These extensions should work with Seed > 2.29.5.3 and Epiphany >= 2.29.3 or so.
