<a href="/files/LifeSaver.zip">Here's</a> my (slow, na√Øve, resource hungry, stupid) implementation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> in a Mac OS X screensaver. Source <a href="/files/LifeSaverSrc.zip">here</a>.

Don't use it on a laptop - it'll suck your battery dry. Don't use it on big displays (it works on my 1440x900 MacBook Pro on battery power just fine, but heats up one of the cores almost completely), it'll be slow. Basically, I'm just posting it here ... for fun. I know there's a billion better ways to do Life. Maybe someday, but not today!
