I've recently been merging a few different music libraries together into my iTunes library on my laptop, so I was interested to see what sort of growth my library's had, over time. I whipped up a quick Perl script (which you can grab yourself, <a href="/files/musicdates.perl">here</a> - though you'll definitely have to modify it to work on Windows). I plotted the data from <em>my</em>&nbsp;library with Mathematica, and got this:

<a href="/files/timlibrary.png"><img src="/files/timlibrary.png" alt="" width="75%" /></a>

There's now a cleaner-but-less-succinct <a href="/files/music-chart.zip">Objective-C version</a>, and its <a href="/files/music-chart.m">source</a>. The built version (first link) will run and then just disappear, having created 'music-chart.csv' in your home directory, which is a CSV of: (UNIX date, iTunes Library Count) pairs. You can chart it with anything that can chart pairs... Mathematica works (ListLinePlot[Import["/Users/hortont/music-chart.csv"], PlotStyle-&gt;Thick]); Numbers might, but I've seen it do nasty things (you have to manually set minimum and maximum X values, or something...); gnuplot will definitely work...
