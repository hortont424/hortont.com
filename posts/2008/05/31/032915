I'm throwing this up here just for fun... it doesn't work entirely, but the general gist of things works. I feel much more comfortable with the Evas source code now than I did at the beginning of the week, but this is really just a start (considering this really isn't related at all to my final project).

Also, unless you, yourself, put the test app in an application bundle, moving and focusing the window won't work. I'll make that automatic sometime soon...
