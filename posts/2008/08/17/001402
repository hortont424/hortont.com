I've started implementing Ecore events. Lots of keyboard events work, and mouse events appear to totally work. Pretty cool!

Keyboard stuff is a mess... I'm borrowing heavily from the ecore_sdl module in that regard, but... they're missing a lot of characters. So, that'll be tonight. Then to clean stuff up and send in an Ecore_Quartz patch. Ehh. I named it Ecore_Quartz. It's more Ecore_Cocoa. Maybe I should change that??

Code is in Git. Including stuff to make test/orig/ecore work with Ecore_[Evas_]Quartz
