So! The first week of my sophomore year at RPI is over; some disconnected notes below:
<ul>
	<li>Our housing is excellent; two large rooms connected by a bathroom, so we've got lots of space; also, Robb and I bunked our beds, so we have a <em>lot</em>Â of space, especially on the other side, which is currently mostly filled with guitars, amps, and various electronic components.</li>
	<li>The only class I tend to be excited to go to is Intro to Visual Communication; the rest are just... bleh. I managed to get a lot of really dry professors this semester...</li>
	<li>It's really, really nice to be back with everyone again! Three months is too long!</li>
	<li>I've finished my GSoC evaluation, and probably won't be blogging about E anymore (or very very very sparsely if so), so if whoever runs planet E wants to remove my blog, that would be cool...</li>
	<li>EMPAC looks awesome. I can't wait until it opens.</li>
	<li>Bunking beds in Davison is hard &mdash; it requires disassembling 4 beds, in total, at least in our case!</li>
	<li>Carol (&amp; DJ)'s apartment is really very cool! Good place to hang out/cook/whatever...</li>
	<li>More later... also I have Carmen and Intervalometer posts to write someday...</li>
</ul>
