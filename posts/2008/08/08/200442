So, I'm not sure exactly where I was last time I wrote about my progress on Evas_Quartz... so I'll just mention the things I know I've done recently...

<strong>1)</strong> Gradients work now! Except, only some of them. It seems that linear, sinusoidal, and angular gradients work, but I haven't seen a radial gradient out of it yet. Not sure that this is my fault, but it really only seems reasonable that it is. I just haven't figured out why yet (anyone care to help?)...

<strong>2)</strong> The biggest problems with the text block layout code (actually, the problems were with my functions for querying Core Text font metrics, as I knew) are all fixed now. Text blocks (at least the ones in Expedite, and the ones I made for my little throwaway test programs) all look great! A part of the solution is very clearly hackish, but it works for now. I've come back to this code, revising it massively, a few times during the project... one more pass should probably do it.

<strong>3)</strong> I spent a lot of time cleaning up memory leaks in #1 and #2. I suppose this is technically part of #1 and #2, but it happened more recently than the initial implementations. Heh.

In truth, I was leaking a lot. A legitimately embarrassing amount, at first... so in an afternoon, it went from >100MB (just silly!) to 100KB, and now it's at 14KB (through the entirety of the test program). The remaining leak is somewhere in the image data access functions (image_data_put, I <em>think</em>)...

<strong>4)</strong> I've got bits and pieces of the Ecore bits <em>started</em>, if you count... nearly empty files compiling and installing properly as started. I haven't added them to Git yet, and I have to find a home for them in Google Code SVN (since the root of that is currently the evas directory... oops). I think it's pretty clear that between sorting out threads/runloops/etc. and ... just ... making Cocoa work like a more conventional system, I'm going to be at this part for well into the school year, which is fine with me (maybe I can convince Robb to point me in the right direction, once I can show him what's up). But maybe there's others that work like this, I don't know. Carbon would certainly be literally a million times easier. Gah!
