I finally finished up first semester with a horrific differential equations final, this morning; shortly afterwards I was whisked northwards by mom. I'm now sitting at home with everyone, for the first time since August! Yay!

Jayne's back up and relocated, 1&amp;1 DNS is doing crazy things, so it's not clear everything is quite working, but should be shortly...

I've got a few long posts in draft form, I have letters to write, lots of projects to do, but first, I'm going to rest a bit...
