So! I recently realized that <a href="http://hortont.com/dump/">the dump</a> probably wasn't the best way to share code. Actually, that's not a recent realization... I just finally got around to doing something about it.

Anyway - I decided to move things into a <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">bazaar</a> repository. There's some code there already, and I've been actively using it for stuff I'm working on now (which I'll write about later). Also, a bzr copy of WebKit, because Robb had forgotten about git://git.webkit.org/WebKit.git, and wanted a DVCS copy of WebKit to help him out... it took quite a few <em>days</em> to generate, so I'm going to leave it there (and keep it up to date).

The repository is accessible through a loggerhead web interface, at:

http://hortont.com/bzr

If you have SSH access to Jayne, you can use:

<b>bzr+ssh://hortont.com/bzr/<i>project</i></b>

to access the repository. You can also create new repositories, and commit to my stuff (but be nice!). Make a new subdirectory of <b>/bzr</b> on Jayne and <b>bzr init</b> inside of it - everything's writable by all of you.

If you don't have SSH access, you can check out projects with:

<b>http://hortont.com/repo/<i>project</i></b>

Anyway... have fun!

P.S. You might want to <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/Download">update</a> your bzr install. I use rich root, for the bzr-svn stuff (WebKit, nano), so you need a recent version. I'm not even sure the bzr that shipped with Intrepid is new enough.

<strong>EDIT:</strong> This is no longer true; I've moved some things to <a href="http://github.com/hortont424">Git</a>, which is how I'm storing everything from here on out.
