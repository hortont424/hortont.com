I know I don't normally do news, but this is quite related to my last MacBook Pro bug post, so here goes...

Yahoo (they've removed the story, as of Dec. 2009) (among others) are reporting that NVidia has <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/io_1215037160521.html">admitted</a> that some of their mobile GPU lines have been failing at higher than usual rates; they're cutting predicted revenue by ~150 million dollars in order to fix this; stock price is dropping, etc...

One wonders if one of the affected GPUs might not include, oh, say, the GeForce 8600M GT?

In any case &mdash; things are looking up for this problem getting solved, perhaps.

Some Evas news and a little Lispy bonus tomorrow!
