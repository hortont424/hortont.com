I've finished my <a href="http://files.hortont.com/doc/tutorial-standalone/tutorial.html">Seed tutorial</a>, which takes you from square one to writing a quick WebKit-based web browser in Seed, while explaining bits of Javascript and GTK along the way.

I tested it out on Matt, and he's got a working copy of the browser now, so I guess it works...
