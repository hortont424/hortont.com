So! Robb <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Seed">announced the first release of Seed tonight</a>! It's been a crazy journey, so far, and we're just starting!

In any case... I'm hacking together Debian packages for our PPA for version 0.2, which will probably land in a week or so... then it'll be <i>really</i> easy to get going...
