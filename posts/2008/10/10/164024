I'm on my way to the GNOME Developer's Summit, but some news just came down the RSS tubes:

<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2377">MacBook Pro video flaw</a>

Apparently they're going to pay us back for having repaired our machines because of the flaw, and they're fixing the flaw for free from now on out (I presume this means out-of-warranty, which is good for everyone!). They're also acknowledging that it was still a problem with machines shipping last month (probably even this month), and that NVIDIA supposedly misled them in suggesting that no MacBook Pros were affected...
