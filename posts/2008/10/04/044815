Yay! It's finally the <a href="http://empac.rpi.edu/events/opening/gala/index.html">opening weekend</a> of the "Curtis R. Priem Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center", or as we've all been calling it for a whole year now, <a href="http://empac.rpi.edu/">EMPAC</a>. It's a pretty big deal for the school, and is almost certainly the sink of most of our tuition money (along with the new athletic village, which makes even <em>less</em> sense...), so hopefully it turns out to be all we're hoping it does!

Amy came down for the weekend to say with Robb and I and to go to the opening weekend events we'd gotten tickets for; to pass the time tonight we went and saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425061/">Get Smart</a> (again) at UPAC; we dragged Matt and Robb (who hadn't seen it before) along with us...

Tomorrow we're going to go to a <a href="http://www.empac.rpi.edu/events/opening/gala/inaugural.html">concert</a>, and various other EMPAC events... should be interesting!! Tonight they've got lots of searchlights (which, of course, made light-pollution-aware Matt somewhat unhappy), as you can see in the picture below!
