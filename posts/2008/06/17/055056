Amy and I have decided we're going to make things more often (cooking/baking/whatever) especially since Mom always does all of the cooking, and that we should write about it somewhere, and keep a list of recipes that seem to have worked. So I'm going to add that as a new thing here... this blog is completely doing-it-wrong, a random assortment of literally <em>everything</em>, but if you don't want something, don't subscribe to that category! :-D

The random cooking this summer started with <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Grandpas-Peanut-Butter-Fudge/Detail.aspx">peanut butter fudge</a> I made, around March 28th. It worked out well, though a candy thermometer would probably have made it a bit easier. I don't have any pictures, sadly, but I'd say it was pretty good. It's possible that making it without chunky peanut butter would have been a better idea, too (whoops!)...
