Amy made me this wallet... three years ago, I think (Amy, it might need repairs or replacement at some point!). I was going to fan out the contents, but basically the whole picture would have to be blurred out due to the various CC/ID numbers. It also contains transportation passes for three big cities (NYC, Boston, and San Diego), and a surprising number of gift cards (bookstores and iTS, mostly).
