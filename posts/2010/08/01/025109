I just noticed that the count of pictures in my Aperture library recently passed 20,000. They're not all my pictures (of note, there are large collections from Vivian, Mireia, Kryzsztof, and the site photographers at both <a href="http://www.giv.org/">GIV</a> and <a href="http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/">π</a>), but most of them are! In fact, over 10,000 of them are from my D80, and another 3,400 are from my previous camera, so that's ~70% right there...

That's a <em>lot</em> of pictures. I will note, however, that over the course of the few weeks of <a href="http://www.hortont.com/projects/intermediate-video/">α ↔ ω</a>, I generated more than the entire rest of my shutter-happy time combined... unfortunately those pictures were far, far too numerous and gigantic to keep around...

Keeping in mind, of course, that 2010 isn't even remotely over yet!
