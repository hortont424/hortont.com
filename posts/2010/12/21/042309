I have two posts stewing - one about a new project (which will probably be held until 0.1) and one about winter break and such, but I realized I never followed up on my D7000 post. So, here's some video!

It's just clips thrown together, no story or anything. It's all also mostly low-light video, so it's rather noisy. I haven't had much chance to be in the sunlight with the camera, since it's so cold. We're going on vacation somewhere <em>warm</em> next week, so I'll probably have a bunch of good video by New Year's.

Definitely <strong>crank it up to 720p</strong>. It doesn't look as awesome as the original here, but at least that comes close!

Also, <strong>mute the audio</strong>! I uploaded it with the audio from the clips intact accidentally, and YouTube's audio swapping doohickey wouldn't let me replace it with silence (as far as I could see anyway). So I replaced it with a random song, which doesn't fit at all. Turn. It. Off.
