We're going to Nassau for Christmas; I'm taking my camera, <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a>, (my first time through it, as one of my vacation projects) and not much else. Don't expect to hear from me for a few days, in any case!

Everybody have an awesome Christmas/New Year's... I'm sure we all will!

On to 2011!
