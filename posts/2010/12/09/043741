Obviously the posts that I promised last week when I wrote about my new camera haven't come yet &mdash; I'm busy trying to compute depth based on bokeh so that I don't fail Computational Vision, and it's starting to work. But then I have to finish a ten page paper on that, so I probably won't have a chance to spend too much time writing until I get home late next week. Luckily Bio is mostly done now, and I'm definitely not going to fail! Yay.

Back to work.
