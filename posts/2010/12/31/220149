There are only a few hours until the end of 2010 &mdash; 2011 is almost here!

Instead of writing something about the year or the decade, I'll leave you with <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/12/reasons-to-be-cheerful.html">Charlie Stross' thoughts</a>. A bunch of the comments are good too.

Here's to yet another year!

P.S. I promise there will be long posts soon... it's been a while!
