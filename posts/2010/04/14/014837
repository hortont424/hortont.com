<strong>A Summer Job</strong>

Good news! I've been offered (and have accepted) an internship position at <a href="http://www.qualcomm.com">Qualcomm</a> in <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=32.711044,-117.14241&spn=0.375536,0.699005&z=11">San Diego</a> for the summer. It's an excellent offer, including relocation to and from California, housing for the summer (sharing a 2-bed 2-bath apartment with another intern), and various other things.

I'm not totally sure what I'm going to be working on (I'll talk more about that in the future, if I can), but it sounds like I'm going to be writing C for some manner of embedded platform for a mobile device, which sounds like fun! I'm really happiest in C anyway, so that works out well for me.

One thing that I was a bit worried about was Amy's graduation: she's finishing high school this summer, and I'm going to be just over 3,000 miles away. My parents decided that they'd fly me home for graduation, in any case, so that I wouldn't have to miss it!

<strong>A New Machine</strong>

Apple <em>finally</em> announced new MacBook Pros yesterday; I'll write more when it gets here, but thanks to Mom and Dad and Vivian and Margaret, there's one headed my way! I got the 15" with the Core i7, the 7200 RPM 500GB disk, and the 1680x1050 display (a much-needed upgrade from 1440x900, but not the resolution I wish it could be...). I'm planning on &mdash; at some point over the summer &mdash; swapping the rarely-used optical drive for an Intel SSD, depending on how Matt's experiments with said drive go over the next few weeks (I expect drooling to ensue). I just have to remember to take my external optical drive to California with me!

Anyway; it's got a name, but I'll share that later, when it gets here.
