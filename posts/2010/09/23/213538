Four trips in just over a month:
<ul>
<li><b>New York</b> &mdash; to the Williamsburg Waterfront to see <a href="http://www.belleandsebastian.com/">Belle &amp; Sebastian</a>, with Nate and Carol.</li>
<li><b>Boston</b> &mdash; for the <a href="http://www.wizardworld.com/home-newengland.html">New England Comiccon</a>, with Matt and Amy.</li>
<li><b>Washington, D.C.</b> &mdash; for Jon Stewart's <a href="http://www.rallytorestoresanity.com/">Rally to Restore Sanity</a>, with Connor, Gino, Nate, Carol, and Matt.</li>
<li><b>Boston</b> &mdash; for <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Boston2010">GNOME Summit Boston</a> with Nate and Matt, and to visit Amy.</li>
</ul>
That's a lot of traveling! Should be fun, though; I haven't been to D.C. in many, many years, and it'll be nice to visit Amy in her new native habitat. Luckily my schedule is extremely light on homework this semester, so it shouldn't be any trouble at all.
