Of course, there was no way I was going to leave well enough alone in regards to this month's crazy schedule:
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://files.hortont.com/busy-october-2010-take3.png" /></div>
Now,
<ul>
<li>I'm going downstate with my family for the weekend</li>
<li>Matt's friend Mary might be visiting the following long weekend</li>
<li>I'm going to the RPI Players' rendition of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest &mdash; the first time I've been to the playhouse since freshman year!</li>
</ul>
That's all of the weekends, people. Time to stop having things for me to do, please!

I've also got some code that makes some neat graphs to show off in a few days (more likely next week because of all of this insanity).
