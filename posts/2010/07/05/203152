The last day of this weekend involved very little other than the ending of an almost-fifteen-year-long tale (75% of my life!) &mdash; that of Woody, Buzz, and company. <em>Toy Story</em> came out just about a year after we moved to Vermont; the second, when I was on my way to middle school; the third and final, just before I start my last year of college. All along, I've been just a few (about three) years older than Andy (indeed &mdash; he's exactly Amy's age), growing up alongside his story. Nothing I can say can add to the tens of thousands of words already published about their many wonders, I can only thank Pixar for giving my generation <em>our</em> stories, something unique and special to hold onto and cherish as a part of our childhood for the rest of our lives, and also for bringing me to laughter and tears in public on <em>many</em> occasions. I can't wait to see what's next...
