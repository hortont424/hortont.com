I'm a little bit late with this post, so it's going to be very short &mdash; this month was <em>crazy</em>. Back at the beginning of the month, I went to two different concerts, both the same band: Belle and Sebastian, twice in just over two weeks.

The first trip was with Nate and Carol, to New York City (Brooklyn's Williamsburg Waterfront, specifically), where the concert was outdoors. The threat of severe rain and thunderstorms loomed over the concert before it started, but <em>somehow</em>, we got exceptionally lucky and felt not more than a few drops. The concert was fantastic; we were standing only a few dozen feet from the stage, close enough that people who were right near us ended up on stage during the audience participation part of the show.

Looking behind us, we could see the entirety of the NYC skyline lit up across the river, which was really beautiful (I've been to NYC a few times, but almost always spend the whole time in the middle of Manhattan, so I've never had the opportunity to see the city lit up at night). Also, standing in the crowd just made it feel... like it was supposed to! Like a Belle and Sebastian concert!

The music was great, the show was great, the weather ended up being great. They hit more or less all of the songs that we wanted, and did a fantastic job, and the classic banter between the leads.

The second show was just as fantastic, musically, but sitting in a theatre led to a ever-so-slightly-less-perfect atmosphere (though it was nice to have functioning legs afterwards!). Still, I had a lot of fun both times, and it was nice to see Amy again and take her to the second show!

We hung out in Boston a bit that night, and went to Comiccon the next day, which you can read about on <a href="http://www.hortona.com/epicness/">Amy's blog</a>.
