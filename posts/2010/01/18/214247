I decided that hosting my Git repos on Jayne was a silly idea. While it did mean nearly infinite storage (and upgrades at a fraction of the price of any alternative) and <em>incredibly</em> fast clones/pushes, having to deal with repository downtime every time I move my computer or decide to start Windows to play a game is simply ridiculous.

So, I've moved everything to <a href="http://github.com/hortont424">GitHub</a>. One visiting my Github profile should keep in mind that a lot of the stuff there wasn't public before, and 90% of it is stuff that got about 1% of the way done and was abandoned, or stuff which is <em>years</em> old at this point. Therefore, browsing around there is <em>not</em> recommended. However, from now on when I reference projects, I'll link to GitHub (and I'll probably go back and update old links in my blog, too).

Interesting repositories include the <a href="http://github.com/hortont424/hortont.com">one for this site</a>; my old GMP+GD <a href="http://github.com/hortont424/mandelbrot">mandelbrot</a> generator; <a href="http://github.com/hortont424/sheeple">Sheeple</a>, the Gtk contact management app I've been working on for RCOS; and <a href="http://github.com/hortont424/aperture-viewer">the code</a> behind my web-based Aperture tag browser.
