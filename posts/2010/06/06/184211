I ran over to the <a href="http://www.aquarium.ucsd.edu/">aquarium</a> near La Jolla Shores today, but it's hard to take pictures through glass. There are a bunch <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hortont/sets/72157624094867995/">here</a>, but I'd rather share my little lizard friend (there were actually dozens of them along the walk down to the aquarium):

In any case, the aquarium was very cute &mdash; if a slight bit small &mdash; lots of local sea life. I especially enjoyed the seahorses... they've got a whole exhibit full of all different shapes and sizes, and they were quite active and very neat. The baby-shark-still-inside-its-transparent-egg was neat in a somewhat disgusting way, too...
