I made a little scatterplot of the number of pictures I've taken each day for the last four-and-almost-one-half years (I have data back further, but it's uninteresting before I had a camera, obviously!).

You'll <em>have</em> to click on it to see details; I've labeled various high-yield or interesting events.

A few things:

<ul>
<li>It's a slightly unfortunate visualization, because high-yield but spread out events (Andros, Barcelona, etc.) are harder to see than short events (like July 4th Fireworks, for example).</li>
<li>It's interesting to note that <em>Matt</em>, not myself, contributed the largest per-day sum of pictures, when he took my camera to "Reptile World" and held the button down the entire time...</li>
<li>You can also see that 2007 has a lot more total points (mostly around the 1 or 2 picture mark), because of <a href="http://apad.hortont.com">APAD</a>!</li>
