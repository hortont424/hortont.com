I wrote about six <a href="http://www.hortont.com/blog/six-perfect-albums/">"perfect" albums</a> about a year and a half ago, and added <a href="http://www.hortont.com/blog/she-some-ants/">another</a> to my list in August. Using the same definition, I have four more to share! These are different because they're all recent &mdash; all four were released long after I was born; three of the four were released within the last decade.

None of these will be a surprise to anyone even remotely familiar with modern music... quite the opposite; at least three of these are considered by many people to be among the <em>best</em> albums of their year (or decade, in one case). But some people (Dad!) might not be familiar with new stuff but might still want to listen...

Without further ado:

<b>Wilco &mdash; Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</b> (2002)<br /><br />
This was initially "The Mike Album" to me, but it's taken on a life of its own over the course of the last few years. It's almost impossible to listen to just one song, it's a start-to-finish-style epic album.

<b>Phoenix &mdash; Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix</b> (2009)<br /><br />
I recently stumbled upon this album accidentally, and have listened to it with ridiculous frequency since then, something which seems to perplex Nate &mdash; who also loves the album, but doesn't expect me to &mdash; constantly pointing out that Phoenix has other albums (someday, Nate, someday!). Countdown and 1901 are my favorites, if you make me choose, but the whole album is fabulous.

<b>Sufjan Stevens &mdash; Illinois</b> (2005)<br /><br />
The second album in Sufjan Steven's now-defunct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufjan_Stevens#The_Fifty_States_Project">Fifty States Project</a>, this is one of the few albums I've experienced with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EzeW5KoPUI">songs</a> (click the link, listen to the lyrics, it's a beautiful song &mdash; but only if you're alone) that can <em>quite literally</em> make you cry. I got into it through <em>Chicago</em>, like most people probably did...

<b>Oasis &mdash; (What's the Story) Morning Glory?</b> (1995)<br /><br />
One of the stereotypical albums of the decade of my childhood (99.999% due to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hzrDeceEKc">Wonderwall</a>), I didn't even acnowledge the existence of the other songs until Carol played the last track for me one day; since then, I've listened to the album in its entirety many times, convinced each time that I've heard the whole thing somewhere before &mdash; I think that's the 90s calling!
