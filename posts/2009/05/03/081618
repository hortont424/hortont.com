I'm leaving RPI today, so I'm pulling an all-nighter to get my side of the room back into proper working order and move all of my stuff into the lounge. Sehrish is coming at 10, so I have six more hours to clean. I seem to have made a mistake, because I don't have a vacuum, Robb's asleep, and I still have more cleaning to do (the bed isn't even back together, mostly because of the lack of a vacuum, actually).

I moved this site to Dreamhost last night, so it'll probably act a little differently. Also, stuff like the Aperture archive, Git, SSH, Planet, etc. won't be back up for a few days, and I'll post about what's up when that comes to pass.

For now, I'll just say that I've had a great semester and I hope that the summer is even better.

<strong>P.S.</strong> As noted <a href="http://www.hortont.com/stuff">here</a>, when everything comes back, Git, SSH, and things like that will be on <a href="http://jayne.hortont.com">jayne.hortont.com</a>, instead of <em>hortont.com</em> directly, since they require more Jayne-eyness than Wordpress and stuff...
