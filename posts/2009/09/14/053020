Two very quick things before I go to bed; class tomorrow! Amy was here this weekend... we had a great deal of fun recording some video for class, playing with the ants (more on that in a minute), losing my keys, and seeing <a href="http://www.myspace.com/deerhunter">Deerhunter</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/boredoms">Boredoms</a> at EMPAC!

<strong>She & Him</strong>

After seeing <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1022603/">(500) Days of Summer</a> with Mom and Amy, I found a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17KUOQOlt8E">music video</a> of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0221046/">Zooey Deschanel</a> (if you follow that link, disregard her IMDB profile picture...) and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330687/">Joseph Gordon-Levitt</a> (the two stars of the movie, the former being the Ã¼ber-adorable actress from the recent <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/">Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a> movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319343/">Elf</a>, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910812/">Tin Man</a>, among other awesome things, the latter being one of the leads in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115082/">3rd Rock from the Sun</a>, and her costar in (500) Days of Summer), dancing to a song which was clearly recorded by Zooey. I'd known she could sing since Elf, but was quite happy to find out she's actually recorded a whole album, as the band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She_&_Him">She & Him</a>, along with 'him', producer M. Ward.

<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=315251745&s=143441">She & Him, Volume One</a> is a <em>really awesome album</em>. I guess I was a little surprised that I could enjoy music that sounds so... old. It really sounds like it's from the 40s or 50s or so, mostly in the way that it's slow and very vocal-centric, but even recording-quality wise (which is a little unfortunate, but other than that, really awesome). In any case, Zooey's voice makes this a really cheery album (even if some of the songs are sadder in nature), and definitely one that everyone should at least give a <em>chance</em>, because it's so pretty!

<strong>EDIT:</strong> apparently there's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BSAT1VSKsY">ANOTHER music video</a> for this song; I'll watch it tomorrow when Matt's not asleep and I can have music!

<strong>EDITx2:</strong> and one for my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T728aTfa5TU&feature=related">favorite</a> of their songs, too... actually apparently that's someone's drawings along with the song, but whatever... still awesome!

<strong>Ants</strong>

The ants for Matt's ant farm arrived this weekend; as such, we spent a good part of the weekend doing entertaining things with ants. Most entertainingly, we put a <a href="http://www.justin.tv/mattarsenaultsantfarm">live webcam</a> on the ants, at least for a little while. This resulted in some <a href="http://www.justin.tv/clip/a341a7d727ef707f">insanity</a> when we decided to spice up the ant's living environment, and even more insanity when we started to get viewers from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/9k076/my_roommate_got_a_glowing_blue_gel_ant_farm_here/">around the internet</a>. We ended up staying up an extra two hours to talk to people on the internet watching our ants, and taking requests for music to play to them! Good fun...
