GNOME 2.28 is out! Now with 100% more Seed!

Also, last Wednesday, my first Intermediate Video project was due. I've <a href="http://vimeo.com/6732774">shoved it to Vimeo</a> for your viewing pleasure. Or not. Amy's awesome in it, but the lighting needs serious help (and I only managed to acquire one of the crappy cameras that has really poor low-light response). There are also some stories surrounding the making of this video and having to call PubSafe because I locked my keys in a room that nobody else I know has access too. Whoops!

Anyway, the next video will be mostly filmed outside; what's not being filmed outside will be filmed with lights (I'm planning on getting 6 large video lights, this time). So it should look a lot better... Unfortunately, it's also going to consume a lot of <em>time</em> &mdash; I'm replicating, to the best of my ability &mdash; the final 3:30 or so of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114814/">The Usual Suspects</a>. Ha! Disaster waiting to happen...
