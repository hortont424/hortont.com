As I'm sure everyone knows already, it's the 40th anniversary of Armstrong &amp; Aldrin's landing on the moon. I really wish I'd been alive to see that &mdash; indeed, nobody's set foot on the moon or elsewhere in my entire lifetime so far! Hopefully we'll remedy that soon... I'd <em>really</em> like to visit, even if just for a short while. Someday!

It's also my 20th birthday! The 20th anniversary of the landing is pretty much one of the best possible birthdays for a geek, in my opinion...

Other things of note... the four of us are going to Boston (to visit schools with Amy) from Wednesday through Saturday; Amy's show (Romance/Romance) was excellent (one of the CTC's best...); Kaitlyn's home!; I started playing around with getting Mines going; etc.

At jclinton's request, I merged gsoc-seed-games into gnome-games master this week, so if you were tracking that, it's gone. Which, of course, means I managed to confuse some translators with unfinished strings and stuff (oops!). Hopefully that's mostly sorted out now (though I did notice that "Same GNOME (Clutter)" and "Same GNOME (Clutter, C)" are still getting translated unnecessarily, and I'm not sure what to do about that/what to call it/etc. Or, if we should just build one or the other depending on if you have Clutter or not... probably.

Some random pictures for your amusement (mostly all what people have seen before):
