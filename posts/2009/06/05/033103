During one of my first conversations with my <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/program/home/google/gsoc2009">GSoC</a> mentor, <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/phomes/">Thomas H.P. Andersen</a>, he suggested that we set up a Launchpad PPA. A PPA would be a great way for people (people using Ubuntu, at least) to get ahold of the very latest work being done with Gnome Games, provide a <u>lot</u> more eyes, and encourage much more feedback from the community during the summer development process.

So, this week, I went ahead and created the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~gnome-games-experimental/+archive/ppa">gnome-games-experimental</a> PPA. It currently contains all of the dependencies for my branch of Gnome Games (including WebKit, seed, gobject-introspection, and Clutter), as well as a build of Gnome Games itself. This build includes three branches:

<strong>gsoc-seed-games</strong> &mdash; my ports of Same Gnome and Mines to Clutter+Seed, and a new game, Lights Off

<strong>gnibbles-clutter</strong> &mdash; <a href="http://damino.ca/">Guillaume Beland</a>'s port of Gnibbles to the Clutter canvas

<strong>sudoku-tube</strong> &mdash; <a href="http://blog.zhangsen.org/">Zhang Sen</a>'s implementation of joint Sudoku games over Telepathy tubes

Keep in mind that we've only been coding for a <em>week and a half</em>, so if you go ahead and try out the PPA today, expect to see very little working, and within what <em>works</em>, lots of horribleness (I personally know of numerous gigantic animation bugs in Lights Off that you'll get to experience!). However, if you <em>do</em> decide to jump onto the cutting edge, you can feel awesome about yourself for helping us out, and you'll also get to play with the finished products <em>long</em> before anyone else.

I plan to update the packages in this PPA once a week at the minimum; you're welcome to use it (please, use it!) and let me know how it goes... I'm new to packaging things (relatively; I packaged bits for <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Seed">Seed</a> before, but that never went well), and I'm probably doing it slightly (or totally) incorrectly. Let me know, and I promise I'll fix it!

It seems to install properly against a fresh Jaunty install (just add the repository, upgrade gnome-games, and watch as the dependency list explodes in your face; most of those won't end up actually being dependencies of Gnome Games, it's gir-repository's fault...); Karmic builds will be ready soon. I make no promises about stability or about these packages not screwing up your machine (especially things that use WebKit)... but if you have trouble, again, please let me know!
