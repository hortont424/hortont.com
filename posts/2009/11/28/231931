My good friend and roommate Matt Arsenault has just pushed the initial (0.1) release of his <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/clutterhs">Clutter bindings for Haskell</a>. This was his <a href="http://www.hortont.com/blog/on-rcos-or-open-software-at-rensselaer/">RCOS</a> project for this semester.

Anyway, if you speak Haskell and enjoy Clutter, download them and see what you can do! He's looking for lots of input for the next steps, so please have at it...
