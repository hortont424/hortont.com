I got all signed up for classes on Thursday. Besides the below, I'm also signed up for Robotics I, but I'm probably going to drop it because it's at 8:30AM three days a week (and is by no means required), and I have plenty of other class. I'm also TAing Inventor's Studio next semester, so that'll take up a good chunk of Wednesday mornings.
