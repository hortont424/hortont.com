The FOSSCamp at <a href="http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDS-Boston">UDS : Hardy Heron</a> was, more or less, my reintroduction to the Linux world... I'd been solely using Mac OS X up until that weekend. Robb dragged Gino and I (and Sarah) down to Boston to hang out with everyone there, and see what was going on. Since, I've become somewhat more involved in said world, mostly through contributions to Seed...

Fast forward to this year: Mom and Dad are helping (for Christmas) to send me to <a href="http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDSKarmic">UDS : Karmic</a>, so I'm going to Barcelona!!

I've been looking around at hotels and flights and stuff; most places in the area only offer doubles, so if anyone's going sans sponsorship and is looking for a roommate (and doesn't mind Hotel Rey Juan Carlos' 200â‚¬-a-night prices), I promise not to be too bad (really, I just might talk about JavaScript a lot... that's all!)! <a href="mailto:hortont424@gmail.com">Email</a> me if you're interested (or, even better, if you know of somewhere in the area that's cheaper!)...
