I just pushed the tarballs/tag of Seed 2.27.90; Robb and Matt and I decided to jump to match the GNOME release number, to reduce confusion now that we're a module. Not sure that was a good idea because people might expect that we've passed "1.0" now, which we most certainly haven't done!

This is the first release to come with the <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/racarr/2009/08/02/seed-ffi/">FFI module</a>, so you can do stuff like this:
<pre lang="javascript">
var app = new ffi.Library();
var strcmp = app.strcmp;

strcmp.signature = {arguments: [GObject.TYPE_STRING, GObject.TYPE_STRING], 
                    returns: GObject.TYPE_INT};

print(strcmp("Hi", "Hi"));
print(strcmp("Boo", "Foo"));
print(strcmp("Foo", "Boo"));
</pre>

(but please, only do that if you're really crazy... there are more useful applications; Robb has an <a href="http://git.gnome.org/cgit/seed/tree/modules/ffi/test-xlib.js">example that calls out to XLib</a>, too... which is a little longer but a good bit less silly...)

It also comes with a much more attractive way to install properties on GTypes. I haven't yet written documentation for this, but will in the next cycle. For now, I'll just note that it lets you do things like this:

<pre lang="javascript">
OscillatorWidget = new GType({
    parent: Gtk.VBox.type,
    name: "OscillatorWidget",
    properties: [
        {
          name: "frequency",
          type: GObject.TYPE_INT,
          default_value: 1000,
          minimum_value: 0,
          maximum_value: 3000
    	}
    ], 
...
</pre>

The property's flags default to readable/writable, but you can mark them as construct properties and then set them with the JSON construction notation. As I said before, documentation and polish are forthcoming.

And, for your reading pleasure, the Seed 2.27.90 complete ChangeLog:

<ul>
<li>Expanded and updated documentation; also available at <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/seed/unstable/">library.gnome.org</a></li>

<li>All JavaScript contexts now have a __script_path__ property, which exposes the absolute, canonical path to the evaluated script</li>

<li>Add __init__.js functionality; if an imported folder contains __init__.js, it will be evaluated with the imported context as the 'this' object</li>

<li>Fix bug which caused inheritance from a GType created in Seed to fail</li>

<li>Add "pretty" property installation, see <a href="http://git.gnome.org/cgit/seed/tree/tests/javascript/gtypes/gtype-property-nice.js">gtype-property-nice.js</a></li>

<li>New FFI module, provides an interface for calling non-introspected native C functions from JavaScript</li>
</ul>
