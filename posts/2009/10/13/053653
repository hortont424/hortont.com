I just got back from GNOME Summit Boston; I'll write about that experience at a later date... I edited together the first 2/3 or so of the video on the train on the way down to Boston (I had to work on proglang homework on the way back, which I <em>somehow</em> finished within the bounds of a single day), and tonight I started throwing the audio montage on. I'm really not sure what I'm going to do about the music, though, because there's simply no way I can duplicate the whole thing in time. At least, not if I want it to sound good...

Also, Nate sprained his ankle, so recording the last bits of video tomorrow is going to be really awkward. In addition to the fact that I don't have any extra actors to be the few remaining people. <em>Really</em> bad.

Remind me not to do anything for my final project (the next project) that requires cooperation; I'm really bad at shepherding people/asking people for help/etc... and it's not good!

We'll see. It'll get done, somehow.
