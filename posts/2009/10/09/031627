I can't believe how hard it is to break a mug. We had to break it into two pieces with a hammer, then hold it together while dropping it (with liquid in it!). It worked out not-too-bad; we then slowed it down to 25%, which is a little sketchy because of the already-really-low framerate, but Motion seems to have done a reasonably good job making it not look <em>horrible</em>.
