Today marked the end of a somewhat awesome semester of Intermediate Video; with that, of course, marked the end of our final projects.

I've got a lot of stories to tell about this project, but very little time right now to tell them! There's a big test that I <em>need</em> to do well on tomorrow (the last one was during the week I was out sick; I ended up taking it right after I got better, to not-so-great-effect), as well as a lovely RCOS presentation that I need to prepare. So, stories later.

For now, there's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7zgx5hW0xg">copy of the video at YouTube</a> (I apologize for the bars and tone; the professor requires them, and I forgot to remove them before uploading; jump to 0:30 to skip them!). Watch it in HD!

Or, if you're adventurous (and have a <em>lot</em> of time), there's a 400+MB H.264@720p version <a href="http://jayne.hortont.com/alpha-omega.mov">on Jayne</a>.

The music (which I made overnight last night, in Logic, and isn't very good) is <a href="http://files.hortont.com/alpha-omega-score.mp3">around</a>, too.

It was a fun video to make, anyway! I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the data; the RAWs are wayyyyy too big to keep around, but the Apple Intermediate files are only a few gigabytes, so I might (should) keep them.
