Today marked the end of a somewhat awesome semester of Intermediate Video; with that, of course, marked the end of our final projects.

I've got a lot of stories to tell about this project, but very little time right now to tell them! There's a big test that I <em>need</em> to do well on tomorrow (the last one was during the week I was out sick; I ended up taking it right after I got better, to not-so-great-effect), as well as a lovely RCOS presentation that I need to prepare. So, stories later.

For now, there's a copy of the video at YouTube (I apologize for the bars and tone; the professor requires them, and I forgot to remove them before uploading; jump to 0:30 to skip them!):

<object width="580" height="360"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/b7zgx5hW0xg&hl=en_US&fs=1&hd=1&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/b7zgx5hW0xg&hl=en_US&fs=1&hd=1&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="580" height="360"></embed></object>

Or, if you're adventurous (and have a <em>lot</em> of time), there's a 400+MB H.264@720p version <a href="http://jayne.hortont.com/alpha-omega.mov">on Jayne</a>.

The music (which I made overnight last night, in Logic, and isn't very good) is <a href="http://hortont.com/files/alpha-omega-score.mp3">around</a>, too.

It was a fun video to make, anyway! I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the data; the RAWs are wayyyyy too big to keep around, but the Apple Intermediate files are only a few gigabytes, so I might (should) keep them.
