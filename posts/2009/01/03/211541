I don't write about <em>music</em> much (nor make lists of things, here, much), but I figured I'd share the six most obviously perfect albums, in case any of the few of you here hadn't listened to one of them...

This started as <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/racarr/">Robb</a> and others poking fun at me for calling Boston's <em>Boston</em> a <em>perfect</em> album... so I set out to find a small set of albums that I was OK with calling perfect, instead, so they wouldn't make <em>quite</em> so much fun of me...

"Perfect" means... every song is one you wouldn't mind running into at any point, but also the album as a whole works together... and makes sense. And stuff. I don't have words for music, really...

All but one of the albums are from before I was born, and the remaining one is still 14 years old... this is mostly because of my musical taste, of course, but I think (unfortunately) that the production of "epic" music is probably declining... you can blame it on the studios, artists, society, whatever... I don't know what it is, for sure, but I'd certainly love it if someone repaired the situation!

<b>Boston &mdash; Boston</b> (1976)<br /><br />
This album was the soundtrack for most of my high school career; it remains the most consistently complete and perfect album I've ever heard. Some (Robb/Gino) call it overproduced, among other things...

<b>Radiohead &mdash; The Bends</b> (1995)<br /><br />
I was only recently introduced to this album (and Radiohead in general) by Robb/DJ/Savannah last year. The first half makes for great music the first time through; the second half takes a few plays, but eventually it's hard to hear just one song and stop without completing the album...

<b>The Beatles &mdash; Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</b> (1967)<br /><br />
For a long time before I knew any <i>music</i>, I had a single CD of Beatles songs. It turned out most of them were from Sgt. Pepper; hearing them in context made them all the better!

<b>Pink Floyd &mdash; The Wall</b> (1979)<br /><br />
The longest album on the list, at 80 minutes, The Wall is one that's been with me for quite a while now. You also can't claim to have listened to it until you've listened to it through nice headphones... there's a whole additional... album, if you listen right.

<b>The Beatles &mdash; Rubber Soul</b> (1965)<br /><br />
A significant part of Rubber Soul was the soundtrack for freshman year at RPI; it's also my favorite Beatles album, now, despite the fact that it's comprised of some of their more ignored-but-still-approachable songs.

<b>Genesis &mdash; Invisible Touch</b> (1986)<br /><br />
I was introduced to Genesis by Dad, who has a bunch of albums on CD, including this one. Besides <i>Domino</i>, this album feels short and to the point, which probably contributes a bit to its "perfection". Not complaining about <i>Domino</i>, either, because it's definitely the best song!
