The plan was for Jayne (the machine that serves this blog, the rest of my web stuff, Robb's blog, lots of code, backups, etc.) to be a reasonably stable and very large (storage-wise) machine. The storage part worked, more or less, but the stability is ehh-not-so-much. I have a very consistent problem with libata, but it's not clear why...

Anyway. Here's the facts:
<ul>
<li>I'm using Debian unstable, with Linux 2.6.28.</li>
<li>I've got a <a href="http://www.hortont.com/blog/2008/08/new-computer/">Shuttle case</a>, and a 100 W PSU (!!).</li>
<li>I get the libata errors above, but only after the machine is up for two or so weeks.</li>
<li>I didn't get the error at <i>all</i> during a one-month-long winter break, but it happened once again, two weeks after coming back to RPI.</li>
<li>The problem has <i>never</i> happened when the case is open and a large house fan is on top of the case, which was true for a significant part of last semester.</li>
<li>After the problem occurs, the machine must be left off for a few hours before it will successfully restart.</li>
<li>The disks never <i>report</i> getting anywhere over about 44 degrees C.</li>
<li>Only the root partition ever acquires any errors. Not the big (1.2TB) main partition.</li>
<li>The total <i>potential</i> power use of the system is well over 100 W, and Shuttle recommended <i>against</i> putting both a Core 2 and two disks in this particular combination of case/mobo/PSU.</li>
</ul>
Any ideas?

I've thought about it a lot, and cannot seem to come up with a reasonable explanation. If it's power, software, or the cables, the cooldown time doesn't make any sense; if it's the disks, running for a long time doesn't make any sense, and I've spent a lot of time beating on the disks to try to reproduce it and cannot; if it's heat (which seems most likely), the fact that it's 20 degrees C under the acceptable working temperature of the disks makes that make very little sense (and I never get SMART warnings or anything, just libata transmission errors!)...

If not, I'm pretty sure a good bit of RCOS money this semester is going to head towards a new case/mobo/PSU (keeping the CPU/disks/memory/etc. from Jayne). Unfortunately, that will end up being a <i>much</i> bigger case... I'd also, in that case, have a really adorable little case that would almost definitely work <i>fine</i> with a single disk/an Atom/etc... anyone, anyone?
