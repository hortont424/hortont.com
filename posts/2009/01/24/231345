It's been a long time (20 days) since my last post - in that time:
<ul>
	<li>I've moved back to RPI and gotten settled in.</li>
	<li>We have a new <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President</a>! And he's already <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28788175/">doing</a> a <em>much</em> <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/23/obama.abortion/index.html">better</a> <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/01/22/obama_first_day/index.html">job</a>. *<a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/">high hopes</a>*</li>
	<li>Robb and Matt (and Nate!!) and I have started our next project after Seed. I can't tell you about it yet, because we want to wow everyone once it's done.</li>
	<li>I sat through a 3 hour lecture by <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">RMS</a>, who then stayed in Matt's dorm room, down the hall, and went to dinner with Robb and Matt! (more about this experience later)</li>
	<li>I finished and ordered the second revision Intervalometer PCB, this time, for a "<em>dual-core</em>" intervalometer!</li>
	<li>We've had two weeks of class. <a href="http://litec.rpi.edu/">LITEC</a> is ... incredibly disorganized but awesome; <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~goldberg/09-GT/index.html">Graph Theory</a> is boring and, so far, a repeat of DSA; <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~drinep/modcomp/">ModComp</a>... we'll see; SD&amp;D is strange because it involves designing and writing software with a group of people that I don't know (they all seem cool, though!).</li>
	<li>Seed got a writeup in <a href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/javascript-gtk-bindings.ars">Ars Technica</a>, which was reposted to <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09%2F01%2F19%2F2350235">Slashdot</a> and <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/20797/Building_Desktop_Linux_Applications_with_JavaScript">OSNews</a>, and prompted #seed on Gnome IRC to become slightly busier than usual!</li>
	<li>I got Seed working reasonably reliably on Mac OS X, and am working on <a href="http://macports.org">MacPorts</a> packages (waiting on a new gir-repository release), and wrote a <a href="http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/seed/trunk/examples/pong/pong.js?view=markup">Seed/Clutter Pong</a>, though it's really rough and useless at the moment!</li>
	<li><a href="http://trac.webkit.org">WebKit</a> passed revision number 40,000. This would not be notable except for the fact that Matt has spent most of his waking hours attempting to create Arch binary packages for <em>every single </em>revision of WebKit.</li>
        <li><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hortont">New pictures!</a> Not much, just of all of us (and of Matt's RMS-signed laptop), but still cute!</li>
</ul>
