It's been quite a while since I've written here! While I'm only taking 12 credits this semester, it seems like one of the busier semesters I've had, at least so far... random assorted notes, in no particular order:
<ul>
<li>I got a job! I'll be joining Apple's WebKit team in June. I'm extremely excited; however, in order to keep this website separate from work, this is the first and last time I'll mention this fact.</li>
<li>I'm visiting Silicon Valley during spring break to find an apartment, along with Mom!</li>
<li>Carol got a job! She'll be hanging out in Rochester, at <a href="http://www.harris.com/">Harris Corporation</a>!</li>
<li>I dropped Cryptography/Network Security, because it was unnecessary and was threatening to be the class that I ignore this semester in favor of the more demanding ones.</li>
<li>Notebook has a few new features: indent/unindent region, and a reasonable API for providing access to an engine's globals. Progress is much slower than it was over winter break, because I have to spend so much time on other things...</li>
<li>There are videos on YouTube of my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQjIz9AVKcA">first</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJtBCUOUHm0">second</a> Experimental Game Design games.</li>
<li>I'm spending a lot of time on Experimental Game Design; this always seems to happen with Arts/Communications classes when I take them! This time around, it's because I've committed to being the sole programmer on a really complicated multiplayer game, which puts me a bit out of my element. But I'm making the most of it (even if that involves spending a lot of time on MSDN...)</li>
<li>If EGD takes a lot of time, IT &amp; Society takes up just as much &mdash; there's constantly writing, editing, formatting, or meetings.</li>
<li>Amy and I are going to see Donald Glover (Community's <em>Troy Barnes</em>) do standup and stuff at the Bowery Ballroom in NYC (the same place Carol and I went to see She &amp; Him a while back!)</li>
<li>We're (probably) relicensing Seed under LGPLv2+ so that webkit-gtk can use parts of it. What kind of coincidence is that??</li>
</ul>
