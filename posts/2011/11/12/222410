There are over 15,000 photos in my Flickr photostream... here are the top 15 (the top tenth of a percent!) in terms of view count (almost all because of posts to <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit</a>!):

<b>#1: The BSG Cake</b>

For my 20th birthday, Amy made me an <em>awesome</em> cake in the shape of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)">Battlestar Galactica</a> logo. Earlier in 2009, Amy and I had watched Galactica together, inspiring her choice of cake design for my birthday. As you might expect, it was as delicious as it was awesome-looking! This cake tops the list primarily because we <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/92zwb/my_little_sister_made_me_the_best_scifi_birthday/">posted it to reddit</a>, garnering a comment from none other than geek legend Wil Wheaton (<em>Star Trek</em>'s Wesley Crusher) himself!

<b>#2: Ben's Sandwiches</b>

One of my RPI cohorts decided that it would be cool to graduate a semester early; in order to exact our revenge, a few of us got together and made <em>ridiculous</em> sandwiches for his going-away party. Forget Subway, forget all of the gourmet sandwich houses in Troy (note: there are none!), Carol's was the place to be that night, bar none.

<b>#3: Amy's Firefly Cross-stitch</b>

For my 22nd birthday, Amy was 3000 miles away, so a cake was quite out of the question; instead, something much more lasting: <a href="http://www.hortont.com/blog/firefly-from-amys-hands/">a cross-stitch for my wall</a>, comprised of everyone's favorite characters from Joss Whedon's <em>Firefly</em>! It sits in the entryway to my apartment, and has inspired me to <a href="http://www.hortont.com/blog/8-bit-whedonverse/">vaguely dabble</a> in pixel art.

<b>#4: My Minecraft Animals</b>

Late in the <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> Alpha phase, Robb introduced our apartment to it, leading to 48 straight hours of nothing but crafting. While the furor died down quickly, most of us still play once in a while. For our last Christmas together, I made everyone painted wooden renditions of the mobs from Minecraft. Also comes with a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/f6sr2/check_out_the_mobs_i_made_for_my_roommates/">reddit post</a>.

<b>#5: Robb and Savannah's Hand-XKCD</b>

Robb, Savannah, Matt, Gino, Andrew, and I visited everyone's favorite east-coast city for the first-ever <a href="http://roflcon.org/">ROFLCon</a>. Some (Robb and Savvy) were more bold than others (myself), and went up to Randall Munroe (who needs <a href="http://xkcd.com">no introduction</a>), asking him to "sign their friendship". Besides thinking that Robb was a girl, and mentioning them in his closing speech, I'd say he did a good job, considering the medium involved. No need to explain why this one is on this list.

<b>#6: gnomines-clutter screencast</b>

For GSoC 2009, I (vaguely) worked on some GNOME Games. One which never totally came to fruition was a Minesweeper/Gnomines clone in Clutter/JavaScript. This video got posted to Planet GNOME, and got up the hopes of a lot of people, only to be dashed by my return to RPI and distinct lack of time.

<b>#7: Amy and I posing with the cake from #1</b>

This is just spillover from #1, people clicking the "next" button on Flickr when visiting that image. It is pretty adorable though!

<b>#8: Matt's Eyeball, Take Two</b>

A few months after taking #11 and posting it to reddit, Matt and I decided (or, rather, I decided, and pinned Matt down 'till he agreed &mdash; it's not clear humans enjoy being flashed in the face) to try again. I'd say this one came out a <em>lot</em> better!

<b>#9: Scallops and Chorizo</b>

Another one of my cooking adventures with Carol (adventures which I dreadfully miss now that I'm so far away!); we made scallops and chorizo for dinner one night, straight out of Nigella. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/boe6m/made_nigellas_scallops_and_chorizo_with_my_bff/">Another one with a reddit post</a>... almost like there's a theme here.

<b>#10: Peter and the Cookie</b>

Please don't ask me what this is doing here; finding it here earlier today is what inspired me to do this post. Peter says he posted it to Twitter... I'm not sure that excuses it. Weirdo <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MobileNotifier">MobileNotifier</a> fanbois...

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hortont/6085007892/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6067/6085007892_d3ce39394e_z.jpg" width="100%" /></a>

<b>#11: Matt's Eyeball, Take One</b>

Inspired by a really cool eyeball picture that I can't find right now, I wanted to see if we could find as much detail in Matt's eye. Turns out... we can't. But that didn't stop us from trying!

<b>#12: Mom's Glowman</b>

There's no story here; I found a translucent Christmas ornament, put it on top of my flash, and took a picture, hoping it would come out looking pretty. It did!

<b>#13: A Hopping Bird, in the San Diego sun</b>

Another victim of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/birdpics/comments/cywv4/levitating_bird_leaving_a_bath/">reddit</a>. If memory serves me, this was at one end of San Diego's <em>Old Town</em>. I accidentally caught it at just the right moment, hoverhanding the bird bath...

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hortont/4873718975/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4873718975_4488e6ec53_z.jpg" width="100%" /></a>

<b>#14: A Spinning Bird, in the San Diego Zoo</b>

It's odd to me that all three of these bird pictures make up the bottom of this list; I guess <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/birdpics/comments/cyo4k/little_bird_shaking_off_bathwater/">/r/birdpics</a> is very consistent in view-count! This was in one of the aviaries at the all-around-awesome San Diego Zoo, and was a surprise to me when I got back to sort through my pictures.

<b>#15: A Majestic Bird, in the San Diego Zoo</b>

Of all the pictures from the San Diego Zoo aviaries, this is one of my absolute favorites. I don't know why, it's just a pretty bird and a pretty picture (making good use of my beloved 180mm f/2.8).

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hortont/4824412956/"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/4824412956_7720fff807_z.jpg" width="100%" /></a>
