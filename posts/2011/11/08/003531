I wanted a background based off of <a href="http://www.hortont.com/blog/firefly-from-amys-hands/">Amy's beautiful cross-stitch</a> that sits on my wall, so I grabbed <a href="https://github.com/philippec/Pixen">Pixen</a> and went to town on a digital copy:

<div style="background-color: #988378; text-align: center; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">

</div>

I quickly realized that I needed to do the rest of the Whedonverse too. I'm not done yet, I still have Angel and Dollhouse (and Dr. Horrible!) to go, but here's what I got out of Buffy, which I've been spending a <em>lot</em> of time watching over the last few months:

<div style="background-color: #988378; text-align: center; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;">
<a href="http://files.hortont.com/tv-pixels/buffy.png"><img class="pixels" src="http://files.hortont.com/tv-pixels/buffy-thumb2.png" /></a><br /><br/>

</div>

These were a lot harder to do since I didn't have anything to go by, but it ended up being a lot of fun! I'm most happy with Faith and Anya (the last two, for those unfamiliar with the show), I think they're the most immediately recognizable besides Spike.

The Pixen source files are on <a href="https://github.com/hortont424/tv-pixels">Github</a>. Feel free to fix things (especially Cordelia and Xander!) or make whatever use of them you'd like!
