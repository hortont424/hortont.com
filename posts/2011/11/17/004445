In the world of Internet-driven geeky music, there are few with more of a claim to fame than <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/">Jonathan Coulton</a>. Certainly some are significantly <a href="http://www.monzy.com/">more geeky</a>, or <a href="http://www.kleinfour.com/">nerdy</a>, or whatever (the fact that I just had those two URLs available off the top of my head is rather sad), but none have the nearly universal success of JoCo &mdash; he's one of those rare nearly-universal geek idols. I was introduced to him a few years back by Robb and Savannah, probably around the same time <em>Still Alive</em> launched alongside Portal and the rest of the Orange Box, and I quickly collected a set of favorites which can still be commonly heard playing around my apartment today.

Savannah, Robb, and Matt have all had the opportunity to see him in concert, usually in the Boston area; for some reason, I was never in the right place at the right time... until this weekend! Opening for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They_Might_Be_Giants"><em>They Might Be Giants</em></a> (another geek favorite, if not nearly as extreme, and much more popular!) at the Fillmore in San Francisco, he did a short show, hitting a bunch of his newer material and some of the classics. Having opener play everything you want them never happens &mdash; they'd never have enough time even with a full-length show, in most cases!

Still, there was much excitement to be had in the room when he opened with <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/music/thingaweek/CodeMonkey.mp3"><em>Code Monkey</em></a> (I predicted this quite successfully), much jumping during <a href="http://www.archive.org/download/JocoLooksBack/03IFeelFantastic.mp3"><em>I Feel Fantastic</em></a> (for good reason!), and goofy faux-romantic swaying to <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/wiki/Still_Alive"><em>Still Alive</em></a> (which is insane considering the context, but I get it...)

All-in-all, it was a great time! I'll be keeping my eyes peeled for a full-length concert if he returns to the Bay Area.

The <em>They Might Be Giants</em> portion was also great; they did the entirety of an old album (from 1990!) &mdash; my only experience with them has been through their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_Comes_Science">science-themed children's album</a>, much more recently (well worth it, too... ignore the fact that it was aimed at children), so I didn't have as much context for their part of the show. Still, it was lots of fun; the floor was filled with excited fans, and that's all it takes to make it enjoyable!

After the concert, I had to get a cab ride back to Cupertino (Caltrain shuts down <em>really</em> early on Sundays...), which... is another story in its entirety!
