This Thursday will mark four years since our little group of CHS kids returned from the Bahamian "Big Yard". This year's trip just got back, and it reminded me that I <em>still</em> hadn't done anything with the journal-book-thing I'd been compiling so many years ago. Since it's clear now I won't be printing it, I figured I'd just post the PDF here!

So, <a href="https://files.hortont.com/andros.pdf">here it is!</a> I don't know what kind of sillyness lies within, as it's been years since I've read it, but enough work went into it that it's worth keeping somewhere!
