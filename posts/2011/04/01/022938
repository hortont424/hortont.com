Just in time for the end of the semester, Milkyway@Home, Matt's distributed computing project, has been ported to run on iOS, complete with the ability to download tasks from the Internet and submit results back to the project.

You can now contribute to humanity's understanding of the universe &mdash; on the go!

Visit the <a href="http://milkyway.cs.rpi.edu/milkyway/forum_thread.php?id=2303#46879">forum post</a> if you want to install it on your (jailbroken) iOS 4.0+ device.
