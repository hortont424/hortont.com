The game I've been working on all semester, SAND, is "done" (in the sense that Gamesfest is tomorrow, not in the sense that we're even remotely finished with it). I made a quick trailer for it which is a little bit bizarre because it only shows off 1v1 multiplayer, while the game doesn't work at all without 3v3. Still, it gives a pretty good idea about what the game looks like, if not how it plays.

If you're using Safari, it should show up below, otherwise view it at <a href="http://youtu.be/7aqBUXCIpWo?hd=1">YouTube</a>. Crank up the volume (you have to hear Pete's awesome music!) and quality and give it a watch.
