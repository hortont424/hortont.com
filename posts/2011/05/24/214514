Tomorrow marks the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/news/mer20110524.html">last day</a> NASA will try to get ahold of Spirit, the eldest of the pair of Mars Exploration Rovers.

Dad and I listened to the landings way back when I was just one semester through high school; Spirit's end-of-life is just <em>days</em> before I'm due to graduate from college. The discoveries of both Spirit and Opportunity have provided Martian wonders to observe and ponder throughout the last seven years: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Marsdustdevil2.gif">dust devils</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blueberries_eagle.gif>blueberries</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MarsPanoramaa.jpg">panoramic landscapes</a>, portraits (both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mars_Spirit_rover%27s_solar_panels_covered_with_Dust_-_October_2007.jpg">self-</a> and <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/MRO/news/mro-20061204.html">otherwise</a>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PIA07269-Mars_Rover_Opportunity-Iron_Meteorite.jpg">meteorites</a>, and many more.

It's hard not to anthropomorphize Spirit and Opportunity, as they've been such good friends for so long. Randall, as usual, <a href="http://xkcd.com/695/">does it best</a>. Still, when they landed, we were promised 90 sols. Ninety. Spirit's official death will be after 2,628 sols... I'd say that's a life to be proud of.
