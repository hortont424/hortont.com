<strong>California</strong>

For the first time in my life, there's no clear "next step", and, finally, really no need for one, either. In June I moved across the country, all the way from Vermont to Cupertino, California, following the call of the most amazing job offer I could have imagined.

I spent the summer of 2010 in San Diego, so I'm at least somewhat acquainted with living in California; the Bay Area seems to be a little quieter, but I'm all for that! Plus, it puts me smack dab in the middle of what is quite literally the epicenter of the software world; the PARC and Stanford are to the west, with hundreds of startups dotted along in that direction, stretching all the way to San Francisco; Google is only a few miles north; Apple is less than a block east; and the home of pretty much every American tech company that matters is within <em>biking</em> distance.

I decided quite quickly that it would be best to live as close to campus as possible, as I don't enjoy driving, don't have a car, and hate depending on public transit to get to work (it's fine if you're not on a schedule, like weekend trips, but not for getting to work). When I called to see what was available, there weren't many options; of the four apartment complexed I called, only one had any space, and even they only had two units available at the time.

Luckily, I managed to acquire one of those, and now call home the corner of Homestead and Stelling, right on the border between Cupertino and Sunnyvale, along with five hundred other people! It's a simple apartment, more than big enough for one person (it easily fit two when Matt was here, and we're going to get to see how well it fits four this week when my family comes out!).

I guess I'll take you on a brief tour of what I've done with the place:

It's got a couch, which Peter and I built the first day I moved in, and I've slept on way more than once; a back porch, with some chairs that let me hang out outside occasionally, and a few plants that mom put there when she was out, some of which have died, and some of which have lived happily.

This one is my favorite, because it's the least dead and seems to be the easiest to take care of, and because it doesn't shed purple stuff all over everything like one of the others does.

I have a projector, which projects a 100+ inch image on the wall for when I want to watch <em>Doctor Who</em> or <em>Game of Thrones</em>, or random movies with Peter/Alex/James/Charles/etc. (all of whom are leaving me in the next few weeks to go back to school). Plus the requisite receiver and speakers, with wires running all over the house. And I can stream video and audio to it from any of my Apple devices, wirelessly. Pretty awesome. The convenient thing about a projector is that it gets almost <em>completely</em> out of the way when you aren't using it.

And my extra iPhone as a remote (which is pretty awesome; one remote, just the few buttons I actually need, customized exactly how I want it &mdash; no mode switches or other crap like everyone (especially at Vivian's or at home) is used to, and there's a keyboard for the Apple TV if I want to search for something!)

After a rather harrowing experience driving home from IKEA with it, I also have the requisite computer desk, new home to Jayne and Trinity, and with plenty of space for paper and laptops and tablets galore. And speakers, attached to a legit soundboard, which merges the audio from 1) a cable to plug into random devices 2) Jayne and 3) an AirPort Express, so I can play music from anywhere to it and not have to worry about going under my desk to move the cable around like I had to in Troy. A bit overkill, but it works with no fuss.

Grandma's table and chairs sit in my dining room, which is not so much a dining room as it is an extension of my living room. I don't have many opportunities to use the table as anything but storage; I usually eat at my desk or on the porch.

When I was packing, I found the printed pictures from my closet door in Davison, so I carefully packed them away and put them on my bedroom door here, along with some bits of DJ's pen art. I've also got a little spot on the wall in my room with pictures of past homes; Colchester, Cary, our apartment on 15th St., and the complex in La Jolla. I'll add Hurley if someone finds me a picture.

I've got a second desk in my bedroom, adorned with random electronics, a soldering iron and power supply, and various related things. I haven't had an opportunity to do much here, but as I don't generally feel like working on software when I get home (except on the weekends!), I expect that to become a more common hobby.

The little dresser in my room was also by far the hardest piece of furniture to build. To anyone who complains about IKEA construction: you don't know what you're talking about. Chair, living-room desk, tables, couch &mdash; all IKEA, all relatively straightforward. That dresser, though, ... I got it from some random company on Amazon, and I swear I had holes in my hands by the time I was done constructing it, and I'm still surprised it hasn't fallen apart. But, it does its job.
