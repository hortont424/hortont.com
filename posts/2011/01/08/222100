I recently started using <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/hortont424">Last.fm</a> again (I'd stopped after CoverSutra insisted on randomly bringing up my NVIDIA card, and restarted when I found iScrobbler), and I noticed something interesting about my charts: it's all <i>albums</i> now. Even if I don't like every song, it almost bothers me to play a single song from within an album, or to end an album early; it's pretty clear this wasn't the case three years ago.
